The main goal of this project is to input an image and assign a value between 0 and 1,
where 0 represents sharp particles and 1 represents round particles, as an output. Total of three
approaches were used. The first two approaches were used by defining particle sharpness as
regularity and roundness, respectively. Machine Learning was another approach of this project,
and it was used to set up a comprehensive database of irregular particles and to analyze the
particle sharpness precisely
